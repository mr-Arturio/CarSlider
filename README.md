## Car Slider
---
Custom slider built in `Next.js` with `Tailwind`, where the controller is an SVG car image and the field resembles a road.<br> 
When the user uses the slider, the NavBar gradient color changes shades. 
<br>At the end, there is a 'finish' pin as an SVG icon. Upon reaching the finish line, confetti falls from the top of the screen.

```npm install react-confetti``` <br>
```npm install react-use``` - to use `useWindowSize` for confetti width settings
